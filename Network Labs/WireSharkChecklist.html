        Paragraph one <p>

                                                          Network Lab
        Networks Lab is the most engaging lab operations that I have performed to investigate different protocols.
        HTTP get/post interaction helped me to understand how the Wireshark used to capture the get protocol and post protocol.
        The get protocol is used to acknowledge the Wireshark, the data has been asked and the post protocol is used to post the data that is been taken. Also analysed how https is safer than http because of their authentication schemes.
        Protocol (RFC1321) The message digest Algorithm which uses 2^128 length for authentication to encode the string of characters in the Authorization basic to get the username and password by using base 64.
        Working on Domain Name System helped me to get deeper understanding on local DNS, caching the messages from the DNS.
        NSlookup helps to understand the address of various websites which use different protocols and many servers connected to each of them.
        TCP protocol usage in the Wireshark helped me gain more understanding towards the connection of sequence with acknowledge of data transfer.
        TCP let me to create own trace from the port numbers from the source when the protocol was been called.
        The segment containing TCP being initiated for connection between the SYNACK and SYN while data is being connected to the different packets of data. The minimum buffer to send the data of TCP while retransmitting the different data packets must acknowledge for byte transfer per unit time. UDP helped to determine the length in bytes for the largest payload.
        The relations between the sender packet to the receiver packet as destination must show the sent response for the ports to access both the sender and receiver.
    </p>p&gt;
        Paragraph two <p>

        Internet Protocol Datagram was a well-known traceroutes for each fragment of data transfer and receiver.
        Ping plotter is used to change the size of the echo being sent to test new traceroutes with using TTL.
        The pattern in identification of the field change had to be sorted to check the unchanged ICMP-TTL which exceeds the size.
        IP datagram is used for the echo request to check each fragment of data used for datagram and trace the packet of data.
        NAT protocol helps to capture data packets on both the sender and the receiver end by sending a trace file and trapping the link into the ISP network.
        The Server address from the client side uses to get Ip address from their desired destination ports from the datagram and TCP using the three-way handshake method to communicate checks all the acknowledge and SYN messages and also captures its TTL for synchronization at any different destination. DHCP reduces the configuration errors and allows the administrator to set allocated time for each IP address and it can be used dynamically, for the entire pool of network by using DHCP discover packet, offer packet, request packet, and acknowledgement of the desired packet.
        The DHCP will offer to trace the values of the relay agent used in the router to encapsulate the four message exchanges in the IP Datagram.
        ICMP is used to transmit the source of data from the main routers to the devices by using ping program, traceroute. The ping program sends the packet to the destination host address, if the destination is continuously looking the packet of data, then pings it on.
        The payload of the IP datagram is known as ICMP packet. The echo request being used to check the sequence number, identifier and the checksum. ICMP in traceroute is used to track the source to the target with a trace path.
        By using TTL it prompts the query from where the data packets are moving, and how much longer is it taking depending on the trace packets on the live host to capture the packet of data.</p>p&gt;
